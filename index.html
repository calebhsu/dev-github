            <h3>Even though</h3>
            <p>you aren't much without Git, I deeply appreciate<br>
            your UI. Version control made simple that has<br>
            saved me on multiple occasions when<br>
            I write something<br>
            that breaks everything else...</p>
            <p>(Here's a letter that will help others get to know you better. Let me know what you think.)</p>
            <h3>The best way to get started</h3>
            <p>is to actually meet you at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and<br>
            pick a name (a good one, because this could end up on a resume). And that's all you need (aside from the confirmation email, but you already know that). <br >
            Click around, get familiar with your empty profile (it won't be like that for long!) and keep reading...</p>
            <h3>Your first repository</h3>
            <p>can seem daunting but let's start at the basics. Click the + icon in the upper right and <br>
            enter a reasonable repo name (short, so you it's easier for you to get to know Git ater on). Let's <br>
            initialize with a README, which can be anything from blurb stub to almost-wiki. By the way, if you ever wanted to meet <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, now is the time.) And create repository!</p>
            <p> In all honesty, the next few steps are more easily done through Git, but we're all about UI here right?</p>
            <h3>Let's make a new file...</h3>
            <mark>IMAGE HERE</mark>
            <p>...yeah, that button right there. Give it a name, type some stuff, and...</p>
            <h3>...Prepare to Commit!</h3>
            <p>You sure everything looks nice? Scroll down. In days (or months, or years) to come, you'll probably want <br>
            to remember what you did so enter a concise commit message here <br >
            <mark>IMAGE HERE</mark><br>
            (or use the default one) and give a short description of your newest change. <br>
            Commit your new file, and...! <br>
            See? It's all there, with your most recent commit message and all.</p>
